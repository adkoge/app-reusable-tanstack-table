# Customizable Interactive Table

Recently, I worked on a project that required a robust, adaptable table setup across various sections within an application, each with unique data and layout requirements. The project demanded advanced functionalities—such as customizable columns, dynamic filtering, pagination, and role-based views—so I explored third-party libraries to streamline development while ensuring high performance. I’ve recreated that solution here, and this demo showcases the adaptable table I built to efficiently manage diverse data requirements, offering powerful data handling features and quick adaptability to meet a range of use cases within the application.

## Key Features

- **Search, Sort, Filter:** Multi-functional search and sorting options enhance data accessibility.
- **Flexible Pagination:** Includes dynamic pagination with customizable page size and index, enhancing data display management.
- **Column Configuration:** Easily reorder, hide, or show columns to customize data views.
- **User-Level Views:** Displays tailored views for different users (e.g., admin, company, individual user), highlighting the adaptability of the table component.

## Stack and Tools

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for a performant and styled UI.
- **Data Handling:** TanStack Table for its powerful table management features.
- **Icons:** Custom icons for UI feedback and intuitive navigation.
